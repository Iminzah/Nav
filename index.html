          In this life one has to always visualize and look beyond where they think they can reach.In reference to the novel 'Born a Crime' it is very clear that Trevor Noah's life was full of challenges and he did not let those challenges weigh him down.It is clear that other students would separate themselves from him because of  racism and call him names but he had his own blessing in disguise which was making people laugh.Despite of every challenge he underwent , he remained true to his course.Seeing him as a worldwide celebrated comedian is such a huge testimony compared to his past. Living with his mother and being restrained from going to see his father because of social norms.

          We see that Trevor Noah's mother is a disciplinarian and she knows sparing the road spoils the child so she tries her very best and disciplines Trevor to be straight in his ways.She happens to be a very daring woman as she visualizes ahead and knows she wants to have a child with a white man.Though at that time it could cross no ones mind to have a baby with a white man because it was forbidden.She holds on to her vision and it comes to pass.

        <p class='aboutParagraphs'>Clarifying what you want.This is more important than most people think because once we identify the things that are important to us, it’s easier to notice them. Once we have clarity about our goals, we start to look for ways to accomplish them. Opportunities might have been there all the time but we didn’t look for them, so we didn’t see them.

When you visualize your goals, it forces you to get serious about what you want. Otherwise, there is nothing to visualize but a bunch of half-baked dreams about your future. Visualization takes a hazy idea and turns it into a clear goal. It’s more than a quick fix.

How to make it work for you: Clarity requires precision, so it doesn’t do any good to be content with vague ideas of how you want to live your life. Vague goals sound a lot like this:

I want to be rich.
I want to travel the world.
I want to be respected.
This is the pseudo-goal crap that will never lead you to success because it’s not based in reality. To gain clarity, you will need to sit down and think about how you want events or relationships to unfold, exactly where you want to end up, and exactly what you need to do to get there.

   <p class="aboutParagraph">
     As seasons and times change it is a high time that the youths should realise that white collar jobs are becomeing more and more of scarce.Therefore what wins is the skills that one has apart from the basic education we get.Ones talent can go a long way in sustaining them in life.<br>

      <p class="aboutParagraph">It is very practical espesially during this pandemic of Covid-19.Many people have been retrenched from work due to the reduction in the net profits earned by most companies.This has forced most of them to lay off workers to reduce costs incurred in paying their salaries </p>

       <p class="aboutParagraph">Young people then tend to have no choice than to go back home and stay with their relatives and family.But their is always  a solution to every problem.We as youths can learn new hand work skills and still gain income.This includes weaving of mats ,table cloths,blacksmithing and making of ornaments and artefacts.This will go a long way in making sure we are not idle and also earn some income from hand work.</p>
       <p class="aboutParagraph">Youth empowerment can also be defined as the process whereby young people gain the ability and authority to make informed decisions and implement change in their own lives and the lives of other people. It is a means of encouraging youths to do great things for themselves and also to make great impact in their society.</p>

    Buju Banton in his recent interview with  the Breakfast Club shared that "When you rent a house you cannot change the structure to fit your needs" Meaning you are forced to work with the structure  and if you don't  want,you leave.This is very true because the only thing you can do in this situation is to tune your needs to fit the structure you have at hand.In real life their is no time human needs will be satisfied fully. This is because we as human beings tend to complain a lot. If only we looked at the positive side of things then the world could be a far much better place than it is right now. We as humans are supposed to understand  that we can use every opportunity we have to get something other than keep on complaining what is working and what is not working.

    There are some  structures  we have  inherited from colonial and western  culture.This structures have either affected us negatively or positively.Among the ones  that affected us positively include Education and technology.</p>

   <p class="para">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, beliefs, and habits. Education can take place in formal or informal settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational.The western culture has brought about the aspect of gaining formal education and enlightening the lives of many.This has increased civilisation in the country thus the economic status of the country  spikes up. This makes  the lifestyle of many  better especially in the marginalised areas.It has also brought about changes in the bad customs and beliefs for example Female Genital Mutilation.</p>

   <p class="para" >Technology is another aspect that has been brought about by the western people. First, the evolution of technology is beneficial to humans for several reasons. At the medical level, technology can help treat more sick people and consequently save many lives and combat very harmful viruses and bacteria.
   The invention of the computer was a very important point. Communication is thus enhanced, and companies can communicate more easily with foreign countries. Research is also simplified.
   For companies, progress in implementing strategic technology trends is helping them save time and therefore, money. Exchanges are faster especially with the internet. Sales and purchases are now facilitated and possible worldwide. This allows businesses to buy raw materials with discounts or at reduced prices. Similarly, global tourism has grown.</p>

   <p class="para">The negative impact of western culture is discrimination.Discrimination based on skin color, also known as colorism or shadeism, is a form of prejudice or discrimination in which people who are usually members of the same race are treated differently based on the social implications which come with the cultural meanings which are attached to skin color. Today we define beauty by the lighter the skin the more the beautiful you are.Which is a wrong point of view.</p>
